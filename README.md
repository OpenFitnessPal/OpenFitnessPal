# OpenFitnessPal Rewrite
A WIP rewrite of OpenFitnessPal in QML, for improved QoL, UI features, and an overall significantly smoother experience, designed to be a unified experience between desktop and mobile.

Once this rewrite is feature-complete, a more comprehensive guide for installation, usage, etc. will be put here, and this will be moved to the main repo.
